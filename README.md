# 🔌 Digital Logic Design (DLD) Practical – Proteus Simulations

This repository contains my practical work for the Digital Logic Design (DLD) course, where I designed and simulated sequential logic circuits using **Proteus Design Suite**.

## 📁 Contents

- `FlipFlops/` — Proteus simulations of basic flip-flops (SR, D, JK, T)
- `Registers/` — Register circuits built using flip-flops (4-bit, 8-bit, etc.)
- `Screenshots/` — Output results and circuit diagrams for documentation
- `Reports/` — Short notes or documentation (if any)

## 🧠 What I Did

- ✅ Designed and simulated **SR, JK, D, and T flip-flop** circuits  
- ✅ Built **register circuits** using combinations of flip-flops  
- ✅ Connected inputs, clock pulses, and observed outputs using LEDs and logic analyzers  
- ✅ Analyzed **timing behavior** and state changes during simulation  
- ✅ Used only **Proteus Design Suite** for all simulation and testing

## 🔧 Tools Used

- 💻 **Proteus Design Suite 8.0 or later**

## 🚀 How to Run the Simulations

1. Open any `.DSN` file using Proteus.
2. Press the **Play** button (simulation mode).
3. Use virtual switches or inputs to change states.
4. Observe outputs through **LEDs**, **logic probes**, or **waveform analysis** tools.

## 📚 Learning Outcomes

- Understood the fundamental behavior of flip-flops and how they store binary data  
- Gained practical knowledge of register design and synchronous operations  
- Improved circuit-building and debugging skills using Proteus
